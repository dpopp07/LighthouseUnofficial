	<h2 class='about'> About the Lighthouse Speakeasy </h2>
	<p class='about'>
		The Lighthouse Speakeasy was founded in December of 2015. The project launched with the intention of introducing the art of craft cocktails to our immediate friends. The mission of the bar was to showcase the culinary approach to alcoholic beverages and to encourage people to step out of their comfort zone and experience new flavors.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class='about'>
		We started with a small and simple menu, operated with a limited Google Doc form, and served drinks off of a desk. Now, 16 months later, we have a full menu with over 50 classic, modern, and original cocktails, a full service website and ordering system, and a real bar handcrafted by Dustin's grandfather. We are happy to be carrying out our mission and are thrilled that we have successfully opened the eyes of our guests to a new world of fine beverages.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class='about'>
		Here at the Lighthouse, we strive to create an experience by cultivating a great atmosphere and using high quality ingredients. We use quality spirits and liqueurs, fresh fruit for all juice and garnishes, and make various syrups, liqueurs, and other ingredients in house (for more information, click the "What we make" tab above). We hope you enjoy our cocktails as much as we do. Thanks for visiting!

	<p class='about'>
		Dustin provides the driving passion behind the Lighthouse Speakeasy. A long-time lover of the culinary arts, it was only a month after turning 21 that he discovered the world of craft cocktails. He hasn't looked back since. For the past year and a half, Dustin has been a dedicated student of the art and science behind bartending and mixology. He is self-taught, learning via the Internet from legendary bartenders such as Tom Macy and Jim Meehan. He can be found up late at night, listening to jazz, working on new recipes, and writing code for this website. His favorite cocktail is the Sazerac.

	<p class='about'>
		Nick is Dustin's roommate and his support was crucial in fostering the Speakeasy from an idea into a successful reality. He is the numbers analyst for the bar, does the Charlie work, and attends all business trips to local liquor and grocery stores. Nick has also tried nearly every drink on the menu and serves as the Head of Guest Relations, encouraging guests to try things outside of their comfort zone. Nick can be found working in Excel, watching soccer, and pretending he likes PBR. His favorite cocktail is the Monte Carlo.
