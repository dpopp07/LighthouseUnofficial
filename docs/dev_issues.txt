Development Issue Tracker for Lighthouse Unofficial

My current big issues:
- *** pressing back button on a single drink page logs out the user ***
- better look on mobile
- sometimes usernames populate as blank to the bartender screen
- bartender page populates eve and dns wrong - quoted drinks !!!!! the issue lies (i think) in processOrderQueue on line 23
- fix single drink titles layout. see candy cane martini for example 

Quick fixes:
- print success message when account is created successfully
- salt passwords for new accounts
- fix link size for logon pages
- reformat the bartender screen (front end)
- add validation to add drink input
- quotes function where applicable
- standardize all of the fonts
- capitalize category names in menu

Ideas:
- menu interface for std users, can go to about page or drink menu or personal order history, etc
- 'view my orders' page for standard users
- use a timesOrdered column in Drinks Table if data processing from Orders is too obnoxious
- give users a different way out of access denied page other than login screen. maybe
- Data analytics page
- universal speakeasy password
- proprieter recommendations

Desired features:
- limited attempts on login
- about page: history and aim of bar, employee bios, rules etc.
- timestamp for order
- mobile design

Issues:
- back button to login page doesnt display logged out message
	- will see how big of an issue this is when i try to use JS
	  to prevent users from viewing restricted pages
* possible solution - hidden form with value + JS
- I want to reload the page on back buttons
- might need to make the drinks database take larger values for description and ingredients
- users drinkCount variable and their actual amount of orders in the database are unrelated. the programming is correct but this is sketchy
- users can sort of hop around with the back and forward button. they cant really do anything but they can cause some errors
- drink count doesnt update well. will probably have to use more php, maybe get rid of the session variable

Major To Dos:
- finish the 'refresh on back button' functionality -> this could be really bad if page load is slow


Notes:
12/20/16 - Working on the mobile layout. Rather than going with the responsive route, I am shortcutting and enlarging everything directly by a factor of 2.75
- all whiskey drinks should reflect whiskey type: fixed
2/9/17 - confirmed that orderDrink.js was unnecessary. deleted and then ordered drinks and everything was fine
